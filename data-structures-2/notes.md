# Call Stack

- A stack is ... a stack of pancakes.
    - You can only butter and syrup on the top pancake. 
    - If you want to maximize butter and syrup per pancake you have to "pop" the top pancake off the stack.
- A stack is such a fundamental data structure that its baked into other data structures for us

- A stack is good for keeping track of what order things happen in


# Recursion

- You get the base case by thinking backwards and starting at the end. When you want your recursive function to stop.
    - Define that first.
