Day 2 Lecture

- Terminal / Command Line Interface (CLI) / Shell
    - They mean different things but get used interchangeably.
    - The terminal is the program that runs a shell
    - The shell is a programming environment
    - Different shell programs
        - Bash
            - Used to be default on Mac OS X 
            - Default shell for many linux distributions
        - zsh
            - Now default on Mac OS X


- Intro to JS!

- Core technology of the web
    - Created by Brendan Eich at Netscape

- Java vs Javascript - **Totally different languages**?
    - Java and Javascript are two totally different, unrelated languages.
    - Java is a static, compiled language.
    - Javascript is a dynamic language with 
    
    - JS on the server/computer
        - Node.js lets run JS outside the browser.

    - Primitive Data Types
        - "primitive" data types are a language's fundamental data type. 
    - JS Primitive Types
        - Strings
        - Numbers
            - Integer (1, 2, -5, 0, etc)
            - Float (4.5, 3.14159)
        - Boolean (true or false)
        - Array
            - A list of other variables in a specific order
        - Null
            - "No value"
        - Undefined

    - Variable Declaration
        - How to declare a variable
            - New ways - you can use either:
                - let
                - const
            - Old ways - DON'T use these:
                - var

        - Declaring a variable tells the computer that "some variable with this name exists", we don't have to give the var a value when we declare.
        - Assigning a value to a variable actually gives it a value.
        - Analogy:
            - Declaration: making a bucket
            - Assigning: putting something into an existing bucket
            - Reassigning: changing what is in the bucket.
        - Namespace:
            - All the names for all the variables that exist in a program.
            - Akin to the telephone book for a city.
