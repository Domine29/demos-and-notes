OOP In Javascript

Javascript is not an object-oriented programming language!
    - Even though it has objects, a JS object is not really the same as a Python or a Ruby object or a Java object. 
    - Even though JS **now** has classes (it didn't used to), they work differently than classes in Python and most other object oriented languages, **in JS world we use classes some but not a lot**.
        - We don't really do inheritance with JS classes.
        - You will see JS classes used sometimes with React.js, though that is changing. 
        - You will see JS classes if you learn and use Typescript. 


So why do we care about OOP in JS?
    - We will learn more about how the JS language works
    - You will see a different way of implementing OOP than with Python.
    - It is important knowledge as we get more into JS later.

In python we have `self`. In JS we have `this`. Both these terms address the same concept -- sort of. 

The `this` keyword in JS.
    - Most of the time you do not need to use `this`
        - Unless you are creating a class.
